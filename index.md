My name is Owen Corbett. I am a queer Irish biologist from Belfast, interested in science communication, education and digital media.

I am a final year PhD student in at University College London, studying the social biology and behaviour of Polistes paper wasps.

This blog is for fun and weird bio-related stories and other bits of science writing, updates roughly fortnightly!

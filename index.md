My name is Owen Corbett. I am a final year PhD student in at University College London, studyingthe social biology and behaviour of Polistes paper wasps.

I am a queer Irish biologist interested in science communication and digital media.

This blog is for fun and weird bio-related stories, updates fortnightly!
